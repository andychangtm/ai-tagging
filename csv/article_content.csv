Skip to:      Current rules on liquids in hand luggage     New rules on liquids in hand luggage     Exemptions to liquids in hand luggage rules   Restricted liquids on flights from UK and Irish airports  Know the limits A person with red nail polish placing small containers of liquid into a clear plastic bag for airport security.  There are restrictions on liquids in your hand luggage. Across UK and Irish airports, these items listed below are always treated as ‘liquids’:      All drinks: including water     Liquid or semi-liquid foods: including soup, jam, honey and syrups     Cosmetics and toiletries: including creams, lotions, oils, perfumes, mascara and lip gloss     Sprays: including shaving foam, hairspray and spray deodorants     Pastes: including toothpaste     Gels: including hair and shower gel     Contact lens solution: including other solutions and items of similar consistency     Lighters: One lighter is allowed on your person throughout the flight, but not inside your bags   If you want to take these liquids in your hand luggage, you need to make sure of a few things:      100ml limit: your liquids must not exceed 100ml.     Clear bag: all your 100ml containers should fit comfortably in a clear, sealed plastic bag that’s no bigger than 20cm x 20cm.     Show security: you must take your bag out at the airport security point.  The 100ml liquid rule changes in 2024  Latest updates on security restrictions  During summer 2024, the rules around taking liquids and electronics through UK and Irish airport security have changed a few times.  Airports have been introducing new 3D scanners that check liquids and electronics without removing them from bags, aiming to shorten queues and allow passengers to bring two litres in their carry-on. Several UK airports, like London City, introduced these new scanners before the government’s initial June 2024 deadline.  However, there’s been a sudden change in rules. Despite Aberdeen, Birmingham, London City, Newcastle, Teesside, Shannon and Donegal meeting the deadline, with the scanners installed, there’s a new UK-wide restriction.  A ‘temporary ban’ has been put in place, meaning the original 100ml liquid rules are back, for now. There’s no information on how long these limits will be in place, but if there are any more changes or updates, we’ll share the latest need-to-knows.  For the EU, it’s a similar story. While many European countries have installed the new scanners, starting in September, all EU airports must follow the 100ml liquid restrictions.  We try to update this article as often as possible. But before you travel, we recommend checking with the airport or looking at the government website. Exemptions to the hand luggage rules  What you can and can’t take A young child sitting on an adult's knee on an aeroplane drinking out of a baby bottle. Duty-free liquids: hand luggage rules  You can bring any liquids purchased at the airport, or on the plane, in your carry-on luggage, even if they exceed the 100ml limit. Just remember you can’t drink anything bought from duty-free during the flight. Depending on the airline, you may need to be able to fit your duty-free items inside your hand luggage when boarding.  Keep in mind: Keep these items and the receipt inside the sealed security bag you receive them in. Medication: hand luggage rules  You can bring essential medicines or creams in your hand luggage, even if they’re more than 100ml. You’ll just need a doctor’s letter or a copy of your prescription. The airport staff will ask to see the letter and they might need to open the containers to screen the liquids.  Watch out: Make sure you leave plenty of time for your doctor to write a note and be prepared to pay an admin fee. Baby food and milk: hand luggage rules  Everything you need for your baby can be packed in hold luggage. On board, you can also bring cooling gel packs, ice packs and breast milk in your carry-on luggage. There’s no limit to the amount of breast milk taken in hand luggage, but it must be in containers that are no larger than 2,000ml. If your little one takes formula, soya or cow’s milk, you can bring these through security as long as your baby is with you – there is no legal limit on the amount, but it’s best to check with the airport before you travel. Your tot must also be present if you’re bringing baby food or sterilised water in your hand luggage.  Good to know: Security staff may ask you to taste your baby’s water or milk. Hand luggage restrictions on baby milk and food Item	Is it allowed in hand luggage? Breast milk	Yes Frozen breast milk	No (hold luggage instead) Soya, formula and cow’s milk	Yes (baby has to be present) Sterilised water	Yes (baby has to be present and water must be in a baby bottle) Baby food	Yes (baby has to be present)  Keep your zen before take-off by staying up to date with the latest travel rules.
